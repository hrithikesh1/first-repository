      <p>
        An AI-Based Attendance System is an advanced solution that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), facial recognition, and biometric verification to track employee attendance accurately.
        <br>
        Unlike traditional systems, AI-powered solutions eliminate the chances of human errors, buddy punching, and time theft.

      <h2>How Does an AI-Based Attendance System Work?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Employee Identification:</strong> Employees check in using facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or voice recognition.
        <br>
        <strong>Real-Time Verification:</strong> The system cross-checks the biometric data with pre-recorded profiles to authenticate the individual.
        <br>
        <strong>Automated Data Logging:</strong> Once verified, attendance data is automatically stored in the system without any manual input.
        <br>
        <strong>Integration with HR Software:</strong> The system syncs with HRMS, payroll, and workforce management tools for seamless operations.
